# Restaurant App

This was a group assignment as part of the course 'Advanced Javascript' in the Front End Developer program at Medieinstitutet (Stockholm). The assignment was to create a restaurant app with a booking system based on certain criteras that is listed further down.

**The application was made by me and [Sanna Ross√§ng](https://github.com/sannarossang). ü§ù**

## Description

The restaurant has 15 tables for six people at each table. The restaurant has two seatings each evening, one at 6:00 PM and one at 9:00 PM. Therefore, all tables are available for booking twice per evening.

If a seating at a given date and time is fully booked, or if you're trying to book for more persons than there are seats left, the time slot will say that it is and you will not be able to go through with a booking.

When a booking is done, you'll get a confirmation with the booking details that also says you're getting an email with all the details. Unfortunately you're not getting an email for real, since this was one of two options and we chose the other one which was to implement a feature where the customer can cancel their reservation.

To cancel your reservation, go to http://localhost:5173/reservation/<your booking id>

## Tech stack

- React
- Typescript
- JavaScript
- MongoDB
- ExpressJS
- NodeJS
- Styled Components

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/feliciacalming/restaurant-app__react.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies in both frontend/backend by running following command in the root of the project:

```bash
npm run install
```

3. Start both frontend/backend by running the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
npm run all
```

That's it! Book a table and enjoy :)
